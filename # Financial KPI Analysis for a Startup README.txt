## 🧰 Tools & Technologies



| Tool     | Purpose |

|----------|---------|

| **Excel**   | KPI calculation (Revenue, CAC, Burn Rate, LTV) |

| **Tableau** | Dashboard creation (visualizing CAC vs LTV and customer trends) |

| **Python**  | Cohort analysis using Pandas and Seaborn |

## 🧮 Key Metrics Calculated



- **Monthly Revenue** = New Customers × Avg Income  

- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** = Marketing Spend ÷ New Customers  

- **Burn Rate** = Marketing Spend – Monthly Revenue  

- **LTV:CAC Ratio** = LTV ÷ CAC



These metrics help evaluate financial efficiency and long-term sustainability.
